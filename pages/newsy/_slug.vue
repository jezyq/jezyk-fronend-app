                  genius and a three time World Series of Poker champion, Stu
                  Unger had a fascinating life story. It was not surprising that
                  after his death Stu was the subject of a biography and a
                  biopic. Stu Unger lived the life of a rock star including the
                  quick rise to fame, the drugs, the comeback and the
                  unavoidable death at an early age. Here you can read about the
                  life story of the legendary poker player Stu Unger. Stuart
                  Errol Ungar was born in 1953 to a Jewish family who lived in
                  Manhattan on the Lower East Side.

                  If you are in the market for a computer, there are a number of
                  factors to consider. Will it be used for your home, your
                  office or perhaps even your home office combo? First off, you
                  will need to set a budget for your new purchase before
                  deciding whether to shop for notebook or desktop computers.
                  Many offices use desktop computers because they are not
                  intended to be moved around a lot.

                  People are wanting to fly to international destinations for
                  vacations but planning a holiday getaway can easily turn into
                  a stressful venture when the matter of costs comes up.
                  However, airfare can be very expensive. Air fare by itself can
                  kill the excitement. And when people already factor in
                  accommodations, food, and shopping, or any other would just
                  give up and stay home.If you think on taking a vacation that
                  requires any sort of wide planning, such as out of the country
                  or worldwide even to a popular destination in a different
                  state, it is probably going to be necessary for you to enlist
                  the services of a travel agency.

                  I’ve got a confession to make. I love television. And I love
                  big screen TVs. Especially the new flat panel models. Before
                  you know it, everyone will forgo their traditional CRT
                  television sets and own a LCD flat screen TV. This idea really
                  isn’t as strange as it sounds. LCD flat screen TVs are
                  becoming more and more popular, and with good reason.
